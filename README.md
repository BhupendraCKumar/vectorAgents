## Overview
Welcome to our project submission for the Agentic AI Incubation Challenge. This repository showcases our end-to-end implementation of an AI-powered sustainability optimization assistant tailored for consumer goods, retail, and logistics domains. The assistant autonomously addresses operational challenges in carbon footprint reduction, waste minimization, and energy efficiency â€” using advanced agentic design patterns and cutting-edge technologies such as Microsoft Azure OpenAI and NVIDIA Vision APIs.

Through modular tools and autonomous agents, our system is capable of:
- Identifying and reducing high-emission routes,
- Monitoring parcel quality through AI vision,
- Suggesting space-efficient container packing to reduce material waste and emissions.

## Explanation
Our solution aligns with the challenge use case: **AI-Powered Sustainability Optimization**. It brings together cloud-based AI tools, multimodal inputs, and classical optimization techniques to autonomously drive sustainability improvements across key operational areas.

The core functionality includes:

- **Route Optimizer**  
  Uses **Azure OpenAI** to classify user intent and apply **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** algorithms to suggest optimal delivery paths â€” helping reduce total travel distance and carbon emissions.

- **Parcel Packing Optimizer**  
  Utilizes the **py3dbp** library to simulate **3D bin packing**, efficiently arranging parcels to reduce unused space in containers and cut down on packaging material waste.

- **Carbon Emission Estimator**  
  Calculates estimated carbon footprint of both naive and optimized routes using fuel efficiency metrics â€” supporting **real-time emission tracking and reduction decisions**.

- **Vision Quality Inspector**  
  Leverages **NVIDIAâ€™s Llama-4 Maverick Vision model** to compare product images and flag damaged or defective items, preventing returns and the waste they generate.

- **Modular Agent Flow**  
  Implements a plug-and-play architecture where agents can work autonomously or in collaboration based on user input and task complexity.

## Intent
The primary intent of our project is to demonstrate how **Agentic AI** can serve as an **autonomous sustainability manager** within the **supply chain and manufacturing ecosystems**. In alignment with the hackathon's business challenge, our system addresses the following impact areas:

### 1. Real-Time Carbon Footprint Tracking & Reduction
- **How**: Computes carbon savings from route optimization.
- **Value**: Enables greener delivery choices by recommending low-emission paths.

### 2. Smart Waste Management & Inventory Optimization
- **How**: Uses vision-based quality checks to reduce returns and product losses. Packs parcels more efficiently to reduce container and material waste.
- **Value**: Minimizes overpacking and product discards, cutting avoidable waste.

### 3. Energy Optimization for Stores & Warehouses (Indirect)
- **How**: Optimized delivery and packing reduce vehicle trips and loading bay usage.
- **Value**: Reduces energy and fuel consumption in warehouse and logistics ops.

### 4. Sustainable Supplier Selection & Procurement *(Extensible)*
- **How**: Framework can be extended to score suppliers based on emissions or ethics.
- **Value**: Enables greener sourcing through intelligent supplier switching logic.

### 5. Automated Sustainability Compliance & Reporting *(Extensible)*
- **How**: Carbon emission data can be structured for ESG dashboards and tax reporting.
- **Value**: Simplifies compliance with sustainability regulations like **EU CBAM**.

Together, these capabilities form a comprehensive solution to support **AI-driven decision making** in the journey toward **sustainable manufacturing and logistics operations**.

## Use Case
**Assigned Industry Use Case**: AI-Powered Sustainability Optimization

AI automatically tracks energy usage, material waste, and carbon footprint across the supply chain, recommending and implementing sustainability improvements.

Our solution is designed to be used by **customer support teams in logistics, courier services, or e-commerce companies**. It can be applied in scenarios such as:
- **Scenario 1**: A customer uploads an image of a damaged parcel to verify if it meets return criteria â€” handled by the Vision Tool.
- **Scenario 2**: A delivery coordinator asks the assistant to reorder parcel drop-offs for an optimized route â€” handled by the Route Optimizer.
- **Scenario 3**: A warehouse manager wants to know how to pack parcels in one container for cost-saving shipment â€” handled by the Container Packing Tool.

  - Routes the user queries to the appropriate agent, such as image comparison, route optimization, or packing optimization.

### 2. **`app.py` â€“ Main Application Entry**
- **Description**: This file serves as the main entry point for running the application. It initializes the agents and manages the user interface.
- **Functionality**:
  - Starts the web server or console interface.
  - Handles incoming requests and routes them to the `agentFlow.py` for processing.

### 3. **`carbonEmissionTool.py` â€“ Carbon Emission Tracker**
- **Description**: This tool calculates and tracks the carbon emissions based on the optimization results for route planning and packaging.
- **Functionality**:
  - Given the optimized route and packaging data, this tool calculates the environmental impact (carbon emissions).
